## Quantumult X related Description：

* **Script remote resources and subscriptions only apply to QX v1.0.0(120). If the version is higher than v1.0.2 (136), you need to point to the local script path yourself.**

* Because the latest version 1.0.2 has limited the "remote resource" of the script, there will be an error in adding the subscription.

### The difference between the versions :

* Store version QX1.0.0 (120) JS function is unlimited, but does not support v2, does not support AlwaysOn

* Store version QX1.0.0 (130) restricts keywords for script VIP types, but supports v2 and supports AlwaysOn

* Store version QX1.0.2 (136) Relaxed certain keyword restrictions, but limited script remote references (script subscriptions), support for v2 and support for http and support AlwaysOn

* **It is currently not possible to get QX1.0.0 (120) via sniffing packet capture because the dev has withdrawn**
